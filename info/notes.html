<h1>
Andean Abyss: Implementation Notes</h1>

<hr>

<p>
Why can't I choose that space for an event?
<p>
You must execute an event as fully as possible. If there are spaces where
you can implement the full event text, you must pick one of these spaces.

<hr>

<p>
Why aren't Shipments held by removed Guerrillas transferred immediately?
<p>
Dropped Shipments are only transferred at the end of an Event, Special Activity, or Operation in a space.
We introduced this slight delay to reduce the number of play interruptions when
opponents are asked to make choices.

<hr>

<p>
Can I remove a Shipment instead of giving it to an enemy faction?

<p>
Yes! This is an errata to rule 4.5.3. Change "if possible, otherwise" to "or".

<p>
Note that 3.3.3 Captured Goods, 4.4.2 Commandeer, and 4.5.4 Contraband override the ability to remove shipments.
Contraband allows the Cartels to decide whether to allow a removal.
