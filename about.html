Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the world's last Marxist guerrilla armies,
brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as
a state. A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural
sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries
were negotiating demobilization. The Government had extended its writ to most
of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and
respect for human rights.

Andean Abyss is a multi-player game depicting insurgent and counterinsurgent
conflict in Colombia during the 1990s and early 2000s. Each player takes the
role of a faction seeking to run Colombian affairs: the Government or one of
three insurgent factions &mdash; the Marxist FARC, the right-wing AUC
paramilitaries, or the narco-trafficking Cartels.
