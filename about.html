<i>Colombia: Nation at the Edge of Abyss</i>

<p>
Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the worldâ€™s last Marxist guerrilla armies,
brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as
a state. A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural
sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries
were negotiating demobilization. The Government had extended its writ to most
of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and
respect for human rights.
